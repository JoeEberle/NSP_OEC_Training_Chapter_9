**epiglottis**: The epiglottis is a flap of cartilage located at the base of the tongue that plays a crucial role in preventing food and liquid from entering the airway during swallowing. Its primary function is to act as a switch between the trachea (windpipe) and the esophagus.
When you swallow, the epiglottis folds over the trachea, blocking the airway and directing food or liquid into the esophagus. This prevents choking and ensures that the airway remains clear for breathing.



The **mechanism of breathing** involves two main processes: inhalation (inspiration) and exhalation (expiration), driven by the action of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles.

1. **Inhalation**: The diaphragm contracts and moves downward, while the intercostal muscles between the ribs contract to expand the chest cavity.
This increases the volume of the thoracic (chest) cavity, creating negative pressure inside the lungs compared to the outside air.
As a result, air is drawn into the lungs through the airways to equalize the pressure.

2. **Exhalation**: The diaphragm relaxes and moves upward, while the intercostal muscles relax, causing the chest cavity to decrease in volume.
This increases the pressure inside the lungs, forcing air out through the airways.
Breathing is controlled by the respiratory centers in the brainstem, which respond to changes in carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the blood. This process ensures a constant exchange of oxygen (for the body’s cells) and carbon dioxide (a waste product) with the external environment.



Here are two common techniques used to manually open the airway or mouth in a patient:

1. **Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift Maneuver** (for non-trauma patients):
Purpose: Opens the airway by preventing the tongue from obstructing the throat.
Steps:
- Place one hand on the patient’s forehead and gently tilt the head back.
- Use the fingertips of your other hand to lift the chin upward.
- This motion helps to open the airway by extending the neck and moving the tongue away from the back of the throat.

Use: For unconscious or unresponsive patients without suspected spinal injuries.



2. **Jaw-Thrust Maneuver** (for trauma patients with possible spinal injury):
Purpose: Opens the airway without moving the head or neck, minimizing risk to the spine.
Steps:
Position yourself at the patient’s head, placing your hands on both sides of the jaw.
Using your index fingers, push the angles of the jaw upward, while stabilizing the head with your thumbs.
This action moves the jaw forward and opens the airway by moving the tongue away from the back of the throat.
Use: For trauma patients or when a spinal injury is suspected.
Both techniques are vital in maintaining an open airway to ensure adequate breathing, especially in emergencies.
